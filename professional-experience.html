          <h5><em>Graduate Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Engineer</em></h5>
          <p class="justify">For my two rotations to date I have worked as an ILS engineer with roles in the maritime and surveillance sectors. My first role was in a sustainment ILS team, where I worked to increase the supportability and availability of different equipment by considering things like spares, transport and packaging, maintenance, technical documents etc. My largest project in this rotation involved completing a supportabilty study for the next 10 years on a whole system. My second role has been more varied. I have contributed to the condition monitoring requirements for the system, done extensive reviews and updates on the design for support design rules, and assisted in completing maintenance task analysis on project systems and inputting it into the LSAR.</p>

          <h2>BESTEC</h2>
          <h5><em>Acoustic Services Engineer</em></h5>
          <p class="justify"> My role at BESTEC was to analyze existing and upcoming property developments and give recommendations to improve the acoustics. There were five main components to this: room acoustics (the sound quality within a room), speech privacy (noise transfer between rooms), noise intrusion (noise from outside), services noise (noise from HVAC systems and generators) and environmental noise (noise from the venue to the surroundings). This involved analyzing drawings, taking measurements on site, performing detailed calculations and sometimes using acoustics modelling software (EASE). Using the results from this certain materials would be recommended for specifc areas of construction, in discussion with the client.</p>

          <h5><em>Project Intern In Bangalore</em></h5>
          <p class="justify"> I completed a 12 week internship in India, where my project was focused on the designing of a robot to clean the solar panels installed on the rooftops of buildings on campus.This involved researching different cleaning methods for solar panels as well as similar products on the market. From my research, reviews and discussions with other engineers I came up with a few concept designs, and selected a preliminary design. A 3D design was created in Solidworks and Catia, giving me experience in both, and the design was presented to senior engineers at the end of the internship. Unfortunately there was not enough time for me to begin creating the robot. </p><p class="justify">On the right: The Infosys Bangalore campus</p>

          <h2>JEUMONT Electric</h2>
          <h5><em>Project Intern/Honours Project in France</em></h5>
          <p class="justify">I completed my final year honours project in JEUMONT Electric's R&D team. This project involved designing a condition monitoring process for their large electric motors to be used both at the factory and after the machine has been handed over to the client. This project gave me experience in:research and technical writing - having had to significantly research condition monitoring in depth to understand it as well as complete a literature review. This allowed me to design the condition monitoring process algorithm, which I completed with flow charts, and then converted that into a program using MATLAB. The program was able to take an input of predominantly vibration data and return a diagnosis on whether the machine was faulty, and if so, what was likely to be the cause of the fault.</p><p class="justify">On the left: The team we worked with at JEUMONT. </p>
